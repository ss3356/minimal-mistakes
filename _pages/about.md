I am a Quantitative Data Analyst at [ClipperData](http://clipperdata.com/). I am part of the Core Data Science team, where I spend most of my time tracking vessels and developing models that provide unique insights into the energy markets.

Prior to Clipper, I obtained my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/).
